# Institut des Neurosciences Cellulaires et Intégratives (INCI CNRS UPR 3212)

Welcome to INCI's GitHub space. Our institute brings together over 130 researchers, engineers, and students investigating the nervous system and its pathologies at the University of Strasbourg. This page will host the repositories from our platforms and plateaux, and link to our research team's personal Github pages.

## 🧠 Research Focus

Our institute approaches neuroscience through three main research axes:

- **Neural Communication**: From molecular mechanisms to network dynamics
- **Biological Rhythms**: Sleep cycles, circadian rhythms and their regulation  
- **Pain Research**: Understanding pain mechanisms and developing therapeutic approaches

## 👥 Research Teams

### Team 1: **Intracellular membrane trafficking in the nervous and neuroendocrine systems** 
*Leaders: Stéphane Gasman & Nicolas Vitale*
> Studies intracellular membrane trafficking events and their dysfunction associated with pathologies such as mental retardation, neurodegenerative diseases, and neuroendocrine cancers.

### [Team 2: **Physiology of neural networks**](https://github.com/TeamNeuralNetworks)
*Leader: Philippe Isope*
> Research in our team is focused on the understanding of synaptic properties underlying functional organization in neuronal microcircuits.

### Team 3: **Opioid system, nociception and pain**
*Leader: Dominique Massotte*
> Investigates the role of the opioid system in nociception and pain, aiming to develop more effective therapeutic strategies to manage neuropathic pain.

### Team 4: **Neurons And Neuromodulation**
*Leader: Y. Sych*
> Studies how noradrenaline affects multiple brain circuits during learning and sleep-dependent memory consolidation

### Team 5: **Pain and psychopathology**
*Leader: Ipek Yalcin*
> Researches chronic pain, focusing on neuropathic pain due to nervous system lesions or diseases. Studies treatments, particularly antidepressant drugs, and the affective and anxio-depressive consequences. Strong expertise in neuroanatomy, studying brain circuits related to pain, emotions, and aminergic systems control.

### Team 6: **Light, vision and brain**
*Leaders: Marie-Paule Felder-Schmittbuhl & Frank Pfrieger*
> Researches molecular and cellular mechanisms regulating retinal physiopathology and its connections with the brain, studying cell-cell interactions, retinal function, development, aging, and disease vulnerability.

### Team 7: **Regulation and disruption of neuroendocrine rhythms**
*Leaders: Etienne Challet & Valérie Simonneaux*
> Investigates how organisms adapt or fail to adapt to environmental changes, focusing on the biodiversity of physiological processes in various animal species and the impact of environmental perturbations on metabolic and reproductive functions.

### [Team 8: **Peptidergic control of emotions**](https://github.com/Team-Charlet)
*Leader: Alexandre Charlet*
> Research focuses on understanding cellular mechanisms underlying the regulation of emotions, exploring how central neuropeptides modulate the neuroglia network in emotion-related structures like the amygdala, using ex vivo and in vivo approaches of electrophysiology and calcium imaging.

### Team 9: **Sleep, Clock, Light & NeuroPsychiatry**
*Leader: Patrice Bourgin*
> Focuses on the functional interactions between sleep, circadian rhythms, and neuropsychiatry, aiming to develop chronotherapeutic interventions to manage sleep, circadian, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

## 🔧 Technical Platforms

### **ComptOpt**
*Mélanie Kremer & Ipek Yalcin*
> Behavioral platform for rodent pain and anxiety models, combining genetic, molecular, and physiological analyses.

### **Laser Microdissection**
*Cristina Sandu*
> Uses laser technology to isolate specific cells from tissues for transcriptomic and proteomic studies.

### **Cryostats**
*Stéphanie Dumont-Kientzy*
> Produces frozen tissue sections (5-100 µm) for histology, immunohistochemistry, and molecular diagnostics.

### **Mass Spectrometry**
*Yannick Goumon & Virginie Andry*
> Identifies and quantifies biological molecules using a ThermoFisher triple quadrupole MS for metabolomics and peptide analysis.

### **Microscopy & Macroscopy**
*Anne-Marie Haeberlé*
> Provides photonic microscopy for imaging and analysis, accessible to trained users.

### **Molecular Biology & Bioinformatics**
*Charles Decraene, Pierre-Eric Lutz*
> Supports nucleic acid extraction, PCR, cloning, sequencing analysis, and bioinformatics.

### **Morpho-Functional Analysis**
*Stéphanie Dumont-Kientzy*
> Assists with tissue imaging, in situ hybridization, immunostaining, and transparency techniques.

### **Real-Time qPCR**
*Vincent Lelievre*
> Offers quantitative PCR for gene expression analysis using a Bio-Rad MyIQ thermocycler.
