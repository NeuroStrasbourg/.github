# Institut des Neurosciences Cellulaires et Intégratives (INCI CNRS UPR 3212)

Welcome to INCI's GitHub space. Our institute brings together over 130 researchers, engineers, and students investigating the nervous system and its pathologies at the University of Strasbourg. This page will host the repositories from our platforms and plateaux, and link to our research team's personal Github pages.

## 🧠 Research Focus

Our institute approaches neuroscience through three main research axes:

- **Neural Communication**: From molecular mechanisms to network dynamics
- **Biological Rhythms**: Sleep cycles, circadian rhythms and their regulation  
- **Pain Research**: Understanding pain mechanisms and developing therapeutic approaches

## 👥 Research Teams

### Team 7: **Regulation and disruption of neuroendocrine rhythms**
*Leaders: Etienne Challet & Valérie Simonneaux*
> Investigates how organisms adapt or fail to adapt to environmental changes, focusing on the biodiversity of physiological processes in various animal species and the impact of environmental perturbations on metabolic and reproductive functions.

### [Team 8: **Peptidergic control of emotions**](https://github.com/Team-Charlet)
*Leader: Alexandre Charlet*
> Research focuses on understanding cellular mechanisms underlying the regulation of emotions, exploring how central neuropeptides modulate the neuroglia network in emotion-related structures like the amygdala, using ex vivo and in vivo approaches of electrophysiology and calcium imaging.

### Team 9: **Sleep, Clock, Light & NeuroPsychiatry**
*Leader: Patrice Bourgin*
> Focuses on the functional interactions between sleep, circadian rhythms, and neuropsychiatry, aiming to develop chronotherapeutic interventions to manage sleep, circadian, and neuropsychiatric disorders.

## 🔧 Technical Platforms

### At INCI

### Technical Platform: **ComptOpt**
*Mélanie Kremer & Ipek Yalcin*
> Focuses on rodent behavior, particularly in models and tests of pain and anxio-depressive disorders. Combines genetic approaches with molecular and physiological measurements to understand the biological bases of behavior studies.

### Technical Platform: **Laser Microdissection**
*Cristina Sandu*
> The laser microdissection technique allows for the isolation of cells or groups of cells on a tissue section based on their phenotypic or functional characteristics. The microdissects are recovered using lasers on a thermosensitive membrane capsule and are compatible with transcriptomic, proteomic, epigenetic, and quantitative PCR analyzes. 
Equipment: Arcturus Veritas laser microdissection system (Excilone) with an inverted fluorescence microscope, IR laser (810 nm), and UV laser (355 nm).
Services include laser microdissector training and sample preparation techniques.

### Technical Platform: **Cryostats**
*Stéphanie Dumont-Kientzy*
> The cryostat allows sections of frozen tissue from 5 µm to 100 µm to be produced in a chamber maintained between -10°C and -27°C depending on the type of tissue. Applications include histological staining, immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, laser microdissection, and molecular diagnostic studies. Only laboratory personnel who have received the necessary instructions during training are authorized to use the Institute's cryostats.

### Technical Platform: **Mass Spectrometry**
*Contacts: Yannick Goumon & Virginie Andry*
> The INCI Mass Spectrometry platform aims to respond to various analysis requests and offer solutions for identifying and quantifying molecules in biology and biochemistry. Applications include small peptide or non-peptide molecules and metabolomics. The platform is equipped with a latest generation triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MS) from ThermoFisher Scientific (2014), which allows quantitative analysis of molecules with a mass range of 10 to 3400 m/z. It features two ionization sources: electrospray (HESI) and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI). The mass spectrometer can be used in direct infusion or coupled with a Dionex Ultimate 3000 UPLC chain for rapid analysis of complex samples. Different analysis modes available include full scan, precursor ion scan, product ion scan, loss of neutral and SRM scan. The device offers high sensitivity combined with low noise for the quantitative analysis of small molecules, peptides, biosimilar and biological substances, providing more signal and less noise for greater precision and accuracy.

### Technical Platform: **Microscopy and Macroscopy**
*Technical Manager: Anne-Marie Haeberlé*
> These microscopy devices are part of the technical photonic microscopy platform at INCI, accessible to statutory and non-statutory members of the INCI. Access is subject to prior reservation, proper training, and authorization. Usage rules include recording usage details, returning settings to standard positions, and ensuring no personal items are left on site.

### Technical Platform: **Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics**
*Contacts: Charles Decraene, Pierre-Eric Lutz*
> The molecular biology and bioinformatics technical platform aims to provide technical support and support for the institute's research projects relating to these different aspects.
