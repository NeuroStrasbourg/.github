# Institut des Neurosciences Cellulaires et Intégratives (INCI)

Welcome to INCI's GitHub space. Our institute brings together over 130 researchers, engineers, and students investigating the nervous system and its pathologies at the University of Strasbourg. This page will host the repositories from our platforms and plateaux, and link to our research team's personal Github pages.

## 🧠 Research Focus

Our institute approaches neuroscience through three main research axes:

- **Neural Communication**: From molecular mechanisms to network dynamics
- **Biological Rhythms**: Sleep cycles, circadian rhythms and their regulation  
- **Pain Research**: Understanding pain mechanisms and developing therapeutic approaches

## 👥 Research Teams

### Team 1: **Membrane Trafficking** 
*Leaders: N. Vitale & S. Gasman*
> Studies intracellular membrane trafficking in nervous and neuroendocrine systems, investigating vesicular dynamics and molecular mechanisms of hormone secretion.

### [Team 2: **Neural Networks**](https://github.com/TeamNeuralNetworks)
*Leader: P. Isope*
> Investigates neural circuits and plasticity in the cerebellum, cortex, spinal cord and olfactory bulb to understand motor coordination and learning.

### Team 3: **Nociceptive Signaling**
*Leader: D. Massotte*
> Examines pain mechanisms in the spinal cord, focusing on signal processing and modulation at cellular and circuit levels.

### Team 4: **Pain Plasticity**
*Leader: P. Poisbeau*
> Studies adaptation in pain control systems, investigating opioid and non-opioid pain modulation mechanisms.

### Team 5: **Pain & Neuroanatomy**
*Leaders: M. Barrot & I. Yalcin*
> Analyzes neural circuits of pain and its emotional consequences, with emphasis on chronic pain conditions.

### Team 6: **Vision & Light**
*Leaders: MP Felder-Schmittbuhl & F. Pfrieger*
> Investigates retinal function and light perception, focusing on circadian rhythms in the retina and visual system development.

### Team 7: **Circadian Biology**
*Leader: E. Challet*
> Studies biological clocks and metabolic rhythms, examining how internal timekeeping systems regulate behavior and physiology.

### Team 8: **Neuroendocrine Rhythms**
*Leader: V. Simonneaux*
> Investigates seasonal regulation of reproduction and metabolism through hormonal and biological rhythm interactions.

### Team 9: **Sleep & Rhythms**
*Leader: P. Bourgin*
> Studies sleep regulation and circadian rhythms through combined clinical and fundamental research approaches.

### Team 10: **Emotion Control**
*Leader: A. Charlet*
> Examines peptidergic modulation of emotional behavior, with focus on oxytocin's role in emotional processing.
