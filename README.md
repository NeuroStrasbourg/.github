Institut des Neurosciences Cellulaires et Intégratives (INCI CNRS UPR 3212)
Welcome to INCI's GitHub space. Our institute brings together over 130 researchers, engineers, and students investigating the nervous system and its pathologies at the University of Strasbourg. This page will host the repositories from our platforms and plateaux, and link to our research team's personal Github pages.

🧠 Research Focus
Our institute approaches neuroscience through three main research axes:

Neural Communication: From molecular mechanisms to network dynamics
Biological Rhythms: Sleep cycles, circadian rhythms and their regulation
Pain Research: Understanding pain mechanisms and developing therapeutic approaches
👥 Research Teams
Team 1: Membrane Trafficking
Leaders: N. Vitale & S. Gasman

Studies intracellular membrane trafficking in nervous and neuroendocrine systems, investigating vesicular dynamics and molecular mechanisms of hormone secretion.

Team 2: Neural Networks
Leader: P. Isope

Investigates neural circuits and plasticity in the cerebellum, cortex, spinal cord and olfactory bulb to understand motor coordination and learning.

Team 3: Nociceptive Signaling
Leader: D. Massotte

Examines pain mechanisms in the spinal cord, focusing on signal processing and modulation at cellular and circuit levels.

Team 5: Pain & Neuroanatomy
Leaders: M. Barrot & I. Yalcin

Analyzes neural circuits of pain and its emotional consequences, with emphasis on chronic pain conditions.

Team 6: Vision & Light
Leaders: MP Felder-Schmittbuhl & F. Pfrieger

Investigates retinal function and light perception, focusing on circadian rhythms in the retina and visual system development.

Team 8: Neuroendocrine & Circadian Rhythms
Leader: V. Simonneaux & E. Challet

Investigates seasonal regulation of reproduction and metabolism through hormonal and biological rhythm interactions. Studies biological clocks and metabolic rhythms, examining how internal timekeeping systems regulate behavior and physiology.

Team 9: Sleep & Rhythms
Leader: P. Bourgin

Studies sleep regulation and circadian rhythms through combined clinical and fundamental research approaches.

Team 10: Emotion Control
Leader: A. Charlet

Examines peptidergic modulation of emotional behavior, with focus on oxytocin's role in emotional processing.

Team 11: ****
Leader: Y. Sych
